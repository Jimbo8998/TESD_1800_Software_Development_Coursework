1. What graphical objects will you use to make this display?
I will use a Polygon to create the pentagon shape and a Rectangle to represent the moving object. 
The rectangle will animate along the outline of the pentagon. I will also use a PathTransition to control the rectangle’s movement along the pentagon’s edges.

2. What listeners will you use?
I will use a setOnMouseClicked event listener to detect left and right mouse clicks.

A left-click will pause the animation.

A right-click will resume the animation.

3. How will you make the rectangle follow the outline?
I will use a PathTransition with the pentagon’s outline (converted to a Polyline or Path). This transition will move the rectangle along the pentagon’s perimeter smoothly.

4. How will you change the rectangle’s opacity?
I will bind the rectangle’s opacity to its current position along the path. 
For example, I can use a FadeTransition or adjust opacity values dynamically during the path transition so the rectangle gradually becomes more transparent and then less transparent as it moves around.
