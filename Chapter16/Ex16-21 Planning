Graphical Objects:
One TextField for entering seconds and one large Label(or Text) to display the remaining time,
arranged in a centered VBox inside a Scene on the Stage.

Listeners:
Handle the Enter key with TextField.setOnAction() to start/restart the countdown,
and optionally timeline.setOnFinished() to trigger music when it reaches zero.

Counting down the timer:
Use a Timeline with a 1-second KeyFrame that decrements an IntegerProperty each tick,
binds the label text to that property, 
and stops when it reaches 0 (disabling the text field while running to prevent edits).

Playing music:
Load an audio file with Media/MediaPlayer,
set player.setCycleCount(MediaPlayer.INDEFINITE),
and call player.play() when the countdown stops at zero (stop the player if the user restarts).
