ATM System Planning:

- Create an array of 10 Account objects with IDs 0 through 9 and initial balance $100.
- Prompt user to enter an ID.
- Validate that ID is between 0 and 9. If invalid, prompt again.
- Once logged in, show menu:
  1. View balance
  2. Withdraw
  3. Deposit
  4. Exit menu and return to ID prompt
- Use a loop so the menu repeats until the user selects 4.
- After exiting the menu, the system prompts for ID again.
- This cycle continues infinitely until program is manually closed.

Steps to be repeated:

- ID prompt and validation
- Displaying the menu
- Executing user choices within the menu
